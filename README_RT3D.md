# Modification of the Fork JimmymaDdness/Mks-TouchScreenFirmware-Duet firmware for stabilizing and optimizing 
### Tested with firmware [RepRapFirmware 3.1.1 Port for LPC (3.1.1-14)](https://github.com/gloomyandy/RepRapFirmware/releases/tag/LPC_RRFv3.1.1-14)

## Stabilizing
For stabilizing the firmware, I changed acces to the RepRapFirmware filesystem.

## Optimizing
I changed the Custom menu to "Macros". So I yan list the Macros and start them from the display.
